# -Main-project--Python-
This project analyzes a dataset from ABC Company containing 458 rows and 9 columns to uncover key insights about their employees. The dataset was preprocessed by correcting the "height" column with realistic values and ensuring overall data integrity. Tasks included determining team distributions, analyzing employee positions, identifying predominant age groups, and investigating salary trends. A correlation analysis was also conducted to explore the relationship between age and salary.

Key findings were presented using visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and scatter plots. The analysis revealed patterns in workforce demographics, team structures, and salary distributions, providing actionable insights for the company. This project showcases Python programming, data preprocessing, and the ability to effectively communicate insights through data storytelling.
